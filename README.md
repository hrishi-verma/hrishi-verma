# Hi, I'm Hrishi.

I’m a software engineer and CS Master’s student who enjoys building web systems that are fast, scalable, and thoughtfully designed.

While my deep expertise is in the JavaScript ecosystem (React/TypeScript), I treat languages as tools, not identities, and enjoy the full process of engineering—from designing data structures to polishing final UI interactions.

### How I work
* **Code:** I write software that is readable, testable, and easy to reason about over time.
* **UX:** I believe technical complexity should never compromise the user experience.
* **Growth:** I’m constantly bridging the gap between academic theory and practical application.

### Current focus 🎓
* **Mastering:** Advanced system design and distributed systems.
* **Refining:** Component patterns and state management strategies.
* **Exploring:** The intersection of algorithm efficiency and real-world performance.

I’m driven by simple curiosity—I just like understanding how things work, whether it’s a compiler or a coffee machine. ☕️

Always open to interesting problems, thoughtful discussions, and collaboration.
